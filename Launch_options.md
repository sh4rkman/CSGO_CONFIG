#### My Personal CSGO launch options

> *-novid  -freq 144 -language english -tickrate 128*  
 

##### Must have : 


**-novid :** disactivate the Valveâ„¢ logo & shit at startup  
**-freq 144:** set the monitor refreshrate  
**-language english:** overwrite english over my french CSGO version  



##### Others :
I'm 99,99% sure this options don't do shit but you can still use it if you're into placebo effect

**-console** Open Console at startup  
Was usefull back when Source was the thing. Not anymore.  
**-w & h** resolution  
It gets forced by autoexec & video.txt anyway    
**-high** high-priority mode  
Placebo, you won't gain FPS from that.
