## VibranceGui

If you have an Nvdia GPU (and if you don't you should) you probably want to activate Digital Vibrance Control :

But if you want to activate NVC for CSGO only, you should use the open source tool VibranceGui :

## Mousefix noaccel

Only if you are stuck on a old Windows version  (XP/7/8/8.1), you might want to use MarkC fix for real rawinput.

## csgo-npp-language 


If you are a true autoexec maniac like me, you maybe want this Notepad++ theme :
- Copy the xml file
- Open Notepad++ and go to Language > Define your Language > Import
- Select the file
- Tadaaaaa magic happends
