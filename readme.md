[Download from GitHub](https://github.com/sh4rkman/CSGO_CONFIG/archive/master.zip "Dowload!")  


## Introduction :


In this package, you'll find my whole go-to setup for Counter Strike Global Offensive, witch include :  

#####Configurations Files :
- **autoexec.cfg** with all my personal sweet binds and alias
- **video.txt** with low graphic settings (and a custom 1440*1080 4/3 resolution)
- **training.cfg** for flash/smoke practicing (require sv_cheats 1)  

##### Various Tools :  
- Raw_input Fix for Windows
- CSGO language for Notepad++  
- Link to the amazing VibranceGUI


## Installation  

:warning:  
**If you need a tutorial for using my autoexec & others things, you should probably stop there.  
You are going to mess with your CSGO Install.**  

- If you know how an autoexec work, some advices anyway :  
  -  I use `unbind all` then re-bind every keys i use in my autoexec. This way i make sure that nothing will move.   
  You **have** to replace my keys by yours in the autoexec, otherwise changes will be lost the next time you launch CSGO. Or erase all my binds (you lazy fucks, they are great).
  -  I use a custom-nonstandard 1440\*1080 resolution in *video.txt*. This is a 4/3 stretched resolution that i like.
  If you want to be able to use it, you need to create it first in your Nvidia Control Panel. ([Tutorial here for Nvidia](http://www.nvidia.com/object/custom_resolutions.html))
  

## VibranceGui

If you have an Nvdia GPU (and if you don't you should) you probably want to activate Digital Vibrance Control :

But if you want to activate DVC for CSGO only, you should use the open source tool VibranceGui :

- [Repo on GitHub](https://github.com/juvlarN "Code")  


## Mousefix noaccel

Only if you are stuck on a old Windows version  (XP/7/8/8.1), you might want to use MarkC fix for real rawinput.

## csgo-npp-language 


If you are a true autoexec maniac like me, you maybe want this Notepad++ theme :
- Copy the xml file
- Open Notepad++ and go to Language > Define your Language > Import
- Select the file
- Tadaaaaa magic happends
